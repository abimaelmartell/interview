# Interview

Create a `Router` class that implements `RouterInterface`.

## Project structure and coding style

All files must follow PSR-0, PSR-1 and PSR-2 (tabs can be used instead of spaces). Keep the project simple and try not to over-engineer things!

## Testing

Write PHPUnit tests inside `tests/` (you must create the folder).

## Version control

Commit every step you make, even if it has errors. **Please don't commit all the functionality and tests at once**, let us see in which order did you write your code.

## Documentation

In case you find it necessary to write documentation, feel free to create a Markdown document or comment the code. This step is not required.
